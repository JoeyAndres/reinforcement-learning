\section*{Todo}
\begin{easylist}
  & \texttt{11/19/2014} Ammending the Environment Module.
  && Modify the Sensor modules. There are some problems such as unused methods in base class for right reasons.
  && Make SensorBase more agnostic, e.g. shed isState function, since this is of no use when the domain of the state is undetermined.
  \\
  && ActuatorBase should also be ammended to capture the problem.
  && As to the tests. Fuck them all. Rewrite the tests so it can be used as an example to the API users.
  \\ 
  && Change template for both actuator and Sensor to $<S, A>$.
  \\
  && Actuators don't need to be overrided for most cased due to Environment, so delete all of them if needed.
  &&& ActuatorRandomWalk

\section*{Tests}
\begin{easylist}
& RandomWalk $\square$
& MountainCar $\square$
& Poker $\square$
& Pole Balancing $\square$
\end{easylist}

\section*{Log}
\begin{easylist}
& 11/18/2014
&& Prefected (for now) Graph modules.
&& Removed DP from design. It seems that DP is not very general as opposed to LP.
&& Create Environment class.
&&& After doing so, introduce formal game test.
\end{easylist}
