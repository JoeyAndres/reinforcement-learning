\subsection{Detailed Description}
Used for {\itshape modeling} environment. 

This module is represents the possible transition states. Every call to State\-Transition\-::update(state, reward), will increase the value of its frequency and at the same time update the reward value. Call to get\-Next\-State would then would return a state on the basis of how likely it occurs. Call to get\-Reward would return the reward of the given state.
