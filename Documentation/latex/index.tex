\subsection*{Introduction}

{\bfseries A\-I\-Project} is library of A.\-I. algorithms. It attempts to cover {\itshape Reinforcement Learning, Supervised Learning, and Unsupervised Learning}. This project is built for learning purposes thus uses beyond that are not recommended.

For examples and tests, I suggest the reader to checkout Tests/ directory.

\subsection*{Installation}

Currently, this project is only tested on Linux Machines. Porting this to Windows will be done in the future.

To compile, g++-\/4.8 and boost 1.\-55 or above is needed. (Lower version of boost might work but not tested). Other than that, simply enter {\itshape make} in terminal and it should compile and build library for you.
