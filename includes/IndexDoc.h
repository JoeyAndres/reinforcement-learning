 *
 * ## Introduction
 * <b>AIProject</b> is library of A.I. algorithms. It attempts to cover
 * <i>Reinforcement Learning, Supervised Learning, and Unsupervised Learning</i>.
 * This project is built for learning purposes thus uses beyond that are not
 * recommended.
 *
 * For examples and tests, I suggest the reader to checkout Tests/ directory.
 *
 * ## Installation
 *
 * Currently, this project is only tested on Linux Machines. Porting this to Windows
 * will be done in the future.
 *
 * To compile, g++-4.8 and boost 1.55 or above is needed. (Lower version of boost might
 * work but not tested). Other than that, simply enter <i>make</i> in terminal and it
 * should compile and build library for you.
